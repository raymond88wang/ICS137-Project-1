        <h1>NanRay History</h1>
        <p>
            NanRay is an e-commerce company founded back in 2017 by founders Raymond Wang and Nancy Wong.
            The company started from the idea that consumers don't necessarily only want the latest trendy apparel,
            but perhaps some quircky ones or a mix of both. Therefore, NanRay was founded on the basis that
            consumers could easily locate and order whatever their quirky needs were on our website easily.
